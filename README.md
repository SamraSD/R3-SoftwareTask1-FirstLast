# R3-SoftwareTask1-FirstLast
For this module I had to connect two 7 segment displays and a potentiometer to an arduino board. I was then tasked to program the arduino so that it will displays numbers on the two 7 segment displays depending on the value produced by the potentiometer. I was able to succesfully wire the two displays and have the potentiometers resistance measured in units from 0-99. However, I could not figure out how to convert a number produced from my potentiometer into 8 distinct signals that will display the digits on the display. First I tried using a divison method which involved using the modulus operations and finding the value of each digit. However, this became too complex and I tried using arrays and masks. I could not figure out a solution that allowed my circuit to work and could not finish.
